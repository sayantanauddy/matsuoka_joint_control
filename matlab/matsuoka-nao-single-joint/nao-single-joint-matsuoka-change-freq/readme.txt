In the first case, the time period of position varies from =1.0 from 0 to 10s, =2.0 from 10 to 20s, = 3.0 from 20s to 30s
However, this causes the amplitude to increase as well.
In the second case, the time period of position varies linearly from 1.0s to 3.0s over 30 seconds, and at the same time,
the tonic input was varied linearly from 3.5 to 1.5 over 30s. This causes the amplitude to be relatively stable, but there
is still a bit of fluctuation.
