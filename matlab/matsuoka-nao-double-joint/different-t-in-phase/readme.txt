Here the right arm has a set of t1,t2 and the left arm has a set of different t1 and t2. (T_r=1.2 and T_l=2.4)

Coupling factor of right arm in left torque = 0.5*mu, 0.5*nu
u_i,u_j for left arm is also 0.5 of that of the right arm (see matsuoka_torque.m)

The right arm is switched on 1.6 seconds after the start.

The coupling is switched on after 10s from the start.

Once the coupling takes effect, we can see that the right arm is almost in-phase with the left but has nearly double the frequency.
