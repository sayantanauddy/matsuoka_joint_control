Simulation is run for 30s. Initially, the joints are out-of-phase. The second joint is switched on after 1.6s. After 10 seconds, the mutual coupling is turned on, and the joints converge to in-phase oscillations.

Open question: how much to pause? Here, realistic behavior is obtained when paused for 0.01s. In the single joint cases, the pause was for 0.1s.
