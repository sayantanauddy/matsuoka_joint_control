Research on bipedal locomotion has yielded a number of different ways in which humanoid robots can be made to walk in a stable manner. In \cite{kajita2003biped}, Kajita et al. present a method to generate ZMP and Center of Mass (CoM) trajectories of the robot using a technique known as preview control, where the reference ZMP is known for a few seconds into the future. In \cite{kajita2010biped} Kajita et al., achieve stabilization using the Linear Inverted Pendulum (LIP) model on a 42-degree-of-freedom (DoF) adult sized humanoid robot. In \cite{kajita20013d}, the authors present a simplified model (3D-LIP) which can be used to accurately model the dynamics of a high DoF robot.\\
\forceindent However, despite the popularity of ZMP based techniques, the gait of even highly sophisticated humanoid robots such as ASIMO is very different from the gait of humans. An interesting alternative to the computationally involved ZMP technique is that of passive walking. McGeer's work \cite{mcgeer1990passive} has shown that highly efficient human like gait can be achieved even by an unactuated humanoid walking down a ramp. McGeer's passive walkers have shown that if the physical constraints of the robot can be utilized efficiently, then

\textbf{Push Recovery and Capture Steps: } In \cite{missura2013omnidirectional, missura2014online, missura2015gradient} the authors argue that pure ZMP based methods rely on sophisticated hardware and are not suitable in situations where the robot may be subject to strong disturbances. The authors have presented a hierarchical gait control architecture where balance control is separated from motion generation. This architecture relies on the LIP model and is able to resist strong disturbances using a combination of different strategies including ZMP. In \cite{stephens2007humanoid}, simple models for humanoids are investigated with respect to push recovery and different recovery strategies are explored. In \cite{rebula2007learning} a strategy for learning capture points for push recovery is presented.\\
\textbf{Reflexive and Sensorimotor control: } In \cite{geng2005fast} a neural network controlled biped walker is presented. A reflexive hierarchical controller controls biped walking without any kind of trajectory control. Reinforcement learning is used to tune the parameters of the controller. In \cite{paul2005sensorimotor} sensorimotor neural networks (one for each leg) control the motion of the biped. The network is optimized using a genetic algorithm. Rhythmic motion is generated without the use of recurrent connections.\\
\textbf{Evolution of Central Pattern Generators: } Central Pattern Generators are biological neural networks which produce rhythmic output on their own without the need of any sensory feedback. The output of the individual networks control the movement of the individual limbs and can be modulated using sensory feedback to produce different kinds of motion. Typically the parameters of the CPG are tuned using some kind of evolutionary algorithm. Various mathematical models, known as oscillators, are available which encapsulate the behavior of the CPG in the form of coupled non-linear differential equations. The most used oscillators are the Van der Pol oscillator \cite{kanamaru2007van}, the Hopf oscillator \cite{Righetti2006} and the Matsuoka oscillator \cite{Matsuoka1985,Matsuoka1987}. In \cite{Righetti2006} and \cite{Kieboom2009}, Hopf oscillators have been used for pattern generation, along with some feedback mechanisms for stabilizations. Taga \cite{Taga1991} produced the seminal work in which Matsuoka oscillators were used for gait generation of a two dimensional planar biped robot. Ishiguro et al. \cite{Ishiguro2003} present an approach in which a CPG circuit is modulated using simulated neuromodulators to achieve stable bipedal locomotion. In \cite{Ijspeert2008} Ijspeert presents a comprehensive review of the use of CPGs for locomotion control.
