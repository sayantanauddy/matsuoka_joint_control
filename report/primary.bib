abstract = {So far various methods using the concept of neural circuit or so-called Central Pattern Generators (CPG) habe been proposed in order to create agile locomotion for legged robots. In contrast to these aproaches, this paper proposes a polymorphic neural circuit which allowes the dynamic change of its properites according to the current situation in real time, to be employed instead. To this end, the concept of neuromodulation is introduced. To verify the feasibility of this approach, this concept is applied to the control of a 3-D biped robot which is intrinsically unstable. The importance of an adaptive controller is illustrated whith the simulations of biped walking on uneven terrain, and the results showed that the biped robot successfully copes with environmental pertubation by dynamically changing the torque output applied to the joints. Furthermore, the proposed approach outperforms monolithic CPG model with sensory feedback.},

abstract = {Autonomic oscillatory activities exist in almost every living thing and most of them are produced by rhythmic activities of the corresponding neural systems (locomotion, respiration, heart beat, etc.). This paper mathematically discusses sustained oscillations generated by mutual inhibition of the neurons which are represented by a continuous-variable model with a kind of fatigue or adaptation effect. If the neural network has no stable stationary state for constant input stimuli, it will generate and sustain some oscillation for any initial state and for any disturbance. Some sufficient conditions for that are given to three types of neural networks: lateral inhibition networks of linearly arrayed neurons, symmetric inhibition networks and cyclic inhibition networks. The result suggests that the adaptation of the neurons plays a very important role for the appearance of the oscillations. Some computer simulations of rhythmic activities are also presented for cyclic inhibition networks consisting of a few neurons.},

abstract = {The problem of controlling locomotion is an area in which neuroscience and robotics can fruitfully interact. In this article, I will review research carried out on locomotor central pattern generators (CPGs), i.e. neural circuits capable of producing coordinated patterns of high-dimensional rhythmic output signals while receiving only simple, low-dimensional, input signals. The review will first cover neurobiological observations concerning locomotor CPGs and their numerical modelling, with a special focus on vertebrates. It will then cover how CPG models implemented as neural networks or systems of coupled oscillators can be used in robotics for controlling the locomotion of articulated robots. The review also presents how robots can be used as scientific tools to obtain a better understanding of the functioning of biological CPGs. Finally, various methods for designing CPGs to control specific modes of locomotion will be briefly reviewed. In this process, I will discuss different types of CPG models, the pros and cons of using CPGs with robots, and the pros and cons of using robots as scientific tools. Open research topics both in biology and in robotics will also be discussed. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We present a system of coupled nonlinear oscillators to be used as programmable central pattern generators, and apply it to control the locomotion of a humanoid robot. Central pattern generators are biological neural networks that can produce coordinated multidimensional rhythmic signals, under the control of simple input signals. They are found both in vertebrate and invertebrate animals for the control of locomotion. In this article, we present a novel system composed of coupled adaptive nonlinear oscillators that can learn arbitrary rhythmic signals in a supervised learning framework. Using adaptive rules implemented as differential equations, parameters such as intrinsic frequencies, amplitudes, and coupling weights are automatically adjusted to replicate a teaching signal. Once the teaching signal is removed, the trajectories remain embedded as the limit cycle of the dynamical system. An interesting aspect of this approach is that the learning is completely embedded into the dynamical system, and does not require external optimization algorithms. We use our system to encapsulate rhythmic trajectories for biped locomotion with a simulated humanoid robot, and demonstrate how it can be used to do online trajectory generation. The system can modulate the speed of locomotion, and even allow the reversal of direction (i.e. walking backwards). The integration of sensory feedback allows the online modulation of trajectories such as to increase the basin of stability of the gaits, and therefore the range of speeds that can be produced},

abstract = {A new principle of sensorimotor control of legged locomotion in an unpredictable environment is proposed on the basis of neurophysiological knowledge and a theory of nonlinear dynamics. Stable and flexible locomotion is realized as a global limit cycle generated by a global entrainment between the rhythmic activities of a nervous system composed of coupled neural oscillators and the rhythmic movements of a musculo-skeletal system including interaction with its environment. Coordinated movements are generated not by slaving to an explicit representation of the precise trajectories of the movement of each part but by dynamic interactions among the nervous system, the musculo-skeletal system and the environment. The performance of a bipedal model based on the above principle was investigated by computer simulation. Walking movements stable to mechanical perturbations and to environmental changes were obtained. Moreover, the model generated not only the walking movement but also the running movement by changing a single parameter nonspecific to the movement. The transitions between the gait patterns occurred with hysteresis.},

@article{Ronsse2009,
abstract = {Current research on discrete and rhythmic movements differs in both experimental procedures and theory, despite the ubiquitous overlap between discrete and rhythmic components in everyday behaviors. Models of rhythmic movements usually use oscillatory systems mimicking central pattern generators (CPGs). In contrast, models of discrete movements often employ optimization principles, thereby reflecting the higher-level cortical resources involved in the generation of such movements. This letter proposes a unified model for the generation of both rhythmic and discrete movements. We show that a physiologically motivated model of a CPG can not only generate simple rhythmic movements with only a small set of parameters, but can also produce discrete movements if the CPG is fed with an exponentially decaying phasic input. We further show that a particular coupling between two of these units can reproduce main findings on in-phase and antiphase stability. Finally, we propose an integrated model of combined rhythmic and discrete movements for the two hands. These movement classes are sequentially addressed in this letter with increasing model complexity. The model variations are discussed in relation to the degree of recruitment of the higher-level cortical resources, necessary for such movements. {\textcopyright} 2008 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

The entrainment and input/output properties of the oscillators are used to perform a variety of tasks with the same architecture, without any modeling of the arm or its environment. The approach is implemented on two real robot arms, and has been used to tune into the resonant frequency of pendulums, perform multi-joint coordinated motion by turning cranks, and exploit the dynamics of a 'Slinky' toy to coordinate the motion of two arms. By exploiting the coupling between the physical arm and the neural oscillator, a range of complex behaviors can be achieved with a very simple system.},

Depending on the diversity of the population the ATRE-PSO switches alternately between three phases of attraction, repulsion and a combination of attraction and repulsion, called the phase of positive conflict [2]. The performance of ATRE-PSO is compared with basic PSO (BPSO) and ARPSO. The numerical results show that besides preserving the rapid convergence of the BPSO, ATRE-PSO also maintains a good diversity in the population. Under most of the test cases, simulations show that ATRE-PSO finds a better solution than BPSO as well as ARPSO.},

A population of individuals, which encode the problem solutions are manipulated according to the rule of survival of the fittest through {\&}ldquo;genetic{\&}rdquo; operations, such as mutation, crossover and reproduction. A best solution is evolved through the generations. In contrast to evolutionary computation techniques, Eberhart and Kennedy developed a different algorithm through simulating social behavior (R.C.

This algorithm is called particle swarm optimization (PSO) since it resembles a school of flying birds.

Each particle adjusts its flying according to its own flying experience and its companions' flying experience.

abstract = {Biped locomotion has proven to be a very hard problem to solve. At current date, there exists no humanoid robot that can move as dynamic and robust as humans do. Even though there has been much research and certainly some interesting progress in biped locomotion, there is certainly no single solution that provides robots with the same ca- pabilities as humans. What seems to be especially lacking is a quantitative method for comparing different solutions. In this work a general method for designing a locomotion controller, independent of the type of robot, is presented. Three distinct stages are iden- tified: Designing the nominal gait, finding a proper encoding of the nominal gait and augmenting the nominal gait to provide stabilization. A nominal gait was successfully evolved using Particle Swarm Optimization algorithms. The nominal gait was encoded into a CPG Network which represents the controller as a dynamical system. Furthermore, a general framework of measuring stability, independent of robot and controller is defined. This allows quantitative comparison of controllers, feedback integration and gaits. Within this framework, stability of the nominal gait was compared with integration of feedback into the CPG. A significant improvement of stability under external perturbation was achieved using simple feedback.},
